Sound at 40 hertz has been linked to gamma brain waves and the stimulation of memory. For an example of 40 hertz therapy.";

For an example of 174 hertz therapy.";

For an example of 285 hertz therapy.";

As one of the Solfeggio frequencies, the 396 hertz tone aids in the removal of the feeling of guilt, making it an effective addition to spiritual music. 396 hertz frequencies balance the root chakra while simultaneously transforming negative emotions such as grief into positive, joyful ones.  For an example of 396Hz healing.";

For an example of 417 hertz therapy.";

A 432 hertz tuning is considered optimal for tuning opera singers and is associated with a higher level of spiritual development. For an example of 432 hertz therapy.";

    const freq7 = "Music that is tuned to the 440 hertz versus 432 hertz is considered “cerebral” music that aids in the listener’s cognitive development. Sound frequencies at 440 hertz are considered to activate the third eye chakra. For an example of 440 hertz sound frequency.";

This musical tone is also known as the “miracle note” and has been used in native populations as a sound associated with blessings since before written history. For an example of 528 hertz sound therapy.";

    const freq9 = "639 hertz is a sound frequency that affects the heart chakra. This sound frequency is associated with therapy intended to produce positive feelings and greater attunement to harmonious interpersonal relationships. As therapy, 639 hertz exposure encourages clearer communication practices and situational awareness. For an example of 639 hertz sound therapy.";

    const freq10 = "852 hertz sound therapy is a tone that is associated with redirecting the mind away from overthinking, intrusive thoughts, and negative thought patterns. These patterns of thought play a larger role in depression and anxiety. Exposure to this sound frequency can help alleviate the role of negative thoughts in these psychological ailments. For an example of 852 hertz sound therapy";

    const freq11 = "963 hertz sound frequencies are associated with activation of the pineal gland and higher spiritual development. The 963 hertz frequency is known as both the “pure miracle tone” and the “frequency of the gods”. 963 is associated with the activation of the crown chakra and a connection to the source of all humanity. For a sample of 963 hertz sound therapy.";
